/**
 * @brief Common state and node-manifest support shared by the ROS-aware behavior tree node base classes.
 *
 * This is a plain (non-`BT::TreeNode`) mixin that holds the RosNodeContext and a per-instance logger. It exists so the
 * ROS-aware wrappers around the basic BehaviorTree.CPP node types (RosSyncActionNode, RosStatefulActionNode,
 * RosConditionNode, RosDecoratorNode, RosControlNode) share identical construction logic instead of duplicating it.
 *
 * Applying the node-manifest port aliasing must be done by the derived node itself (it requires the protected
 * `BT::TreeNode::modifyPortsRemapping`), so this base only provides the remapping to apply via portAliasRemapping();
 * the wrappers call it from their constructor.
 *
 * It additionally provides getSharedEntity(), the shared-entity registry used by the provided ROS node bases
 * (RosPublisherNode, RosSubscriberNode, RosServiceNode, RosActionNode) and available to any downstream node so that
 * equivalent ROS 2 entities (publishers, subscriptions, clients, ...) are created once and shared instead of being
 * duplicated per tree node instance.

   * Behavior tree nodes are frequently instantiated multiple times (e.g. the same topic used by several nodes in a
   * tree). To avoid creating one ROS 2 entity - publisher, subscription, service/action client, or any wrapper thereof
   * - per node instance, entities are shared through a registry keyed by the owning ROS 2 node's fully qualified name
   * and @p entity_name. The first caller for a given key creates the instance via @p factory; subsequent callers
   * receive the same instance for as long as it is still held by at least one node. Once the last owner is destroyed,
   * the entry expires and the next caller creates a fresh instance.
   *
   * A distinct registry is kept per @p InstanceT, so different entity types never collide even if they share a name.
   *
   * @tparam InstanceT Type wrapping (or being) the shared ROS 2 entity.
   * @param entity_name Name identifying the entity (e.g. the topic/service/action name) used to form the registry key.
   * @param factory Callable creating a new instance; only invoked when no live instance exists for the key.
   * @return Shared pointer to the (possibly newly created) shared instance.
